                        By Vilain is for the style-conscious man who wants to
                        take their haircare game to the next level.

                    <p>
                        Our brand is brought to you out of Copenhagen, Denmark:
                        a city alive with art, fashion, partying, and concerts
                        of every kind; tastebud-tempting fine dining; and the
                        24/7 buzz of innovative business and culture. And just
                        like the city: By Vilain men’s grooming products are a
                        Scandinavian blend of stylish sophistication,
                        professional dynamism, avant-garde edge, and clean
                        minimalism.

                    <h1>Our Story</h1>
                    <p>
                        If you walk through our front doors in Aarhus and past
                        our hair studio, you might see our team packing crates
                        to be shipped around the world. There’s probably a few
                        of us in the office working on the website, editing
                        videos or having a coffee together in the kitchen. After
                        more than ten years in the business: we’ve had our highs
                        and our lows, and we’re proud to say we’ve built up a
                        premium-quality brand with By Vilain: made up of
                        professional products like Gold Digger Wax and Sidekick
                        Pre-Styling Spray. From our beginnings at the hair salon
                        to our impact on the global haircare game, we’ve come a
                        long way!

                        “I see our customers as people we help along the way.
                        And it brings a lot of joy to know that.” – Rasmus

                    <p>
                        We’re an upbeat team who love what we do. We’re driven
                        by a vision: to inspire guys to be the best version of
                        themselves and to equip them for success. And over the
                        years, we’ve been touched by the awesome responses we’ve
                        had from happy customers. We’re grateful for the amazing
                        By Vilain community, full of men from around the world
                        who want to continue the journey with us. We continue to
                        inspire men around the world to #workhard and
                        #stylehard.

                        If we help you to put yourself forward with confidence
                        in your next job interview; give you the tools to look
                        your dapper best on your wedding day, or if we make
                        products you rely on again and again - then we know
                        we’ve made a difference, even if it’s only a small one.
                        From our beginnings to where we are today, By Vilain’s
                        commitment has stayed the same:

                    <p>
                        Our goal is to help men along the way to become a better
                        version of themselves.

                    <p>
                        By Vilain was launched by twin brothers and
                        entrepreneurs, Emil and Rasmus Vilain Albrechtsen out of
                        their Aarhus salon in 2013, and the trendsetting brand
                        soon won international recognition in the world of men’s
                        grooming. Since our beginnings, we’ve opened up another
                        location in Denmark’s capital city - Copenhagen. Our
                        brand reflects who we are and where we come from, and
                        our name on the label shows our commitment to
                        uncompromising quality.
